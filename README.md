## 🐕CSS framework made in SCSS with SASS Loader🐩
# What is Bouledogue
Bouledogue is a CSS framework made in SCSS, the main goal behind it's creation was to learn SCSS and make my own 'personnal' CSS framework. As of today i only learned to use Bootstrap, so Bouledogue will be quite a bit inspired by it. The second objective by making Bouledogue is to get confortable with front end web developpement, since i'm mostly a back end PHP developper. 🐾
