# Bouledogue 🐶

## 🐕CSS framework made in SCSS with SASS Loader🐩
# What is Bouledogue
Bouledogue is a CSS framework made in SCSS, the main goal behind it's creation was to learn SCSS and make my own 'personnal' CSS framework. As of today i only learned to use Bootstrap, so Bouledogue will be quite a bit inspired by it. The second objective by making Bouledogue is to get more confortable with front end web developpement, since i'm mostly a back end PHP developper. 🐾
# Installation
Select from what source you want to install Bouledogue
## From GitHub
1. Download the last version of bouledogue.css from the release tab or build from source files
2. Include it to your index.html, index.php or whatever
3. Done 🐶
## From npm NOT DONE YET
1. Download it from your favourite package manager (yarn, npm...) like
> npm add bouledogue

Or

> yarn bouledogue

2. Include it to your index file
3. Done 🐶

# How to build
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependancies using your favourite depandacies manager such as npm or yarn
3. Run the build script by doing 
> npm run build

Or

> yarn run build

4. A bouledogue.css file should appear in the CSS folder, by default it will be compressed.

# Developpement
Since it's a learning project i don't plan to merge pull requests or ask for contribution on this project, however feel free to fork it.

Also for developpement purposes, i suggest to use the watch script instead of the build one.
> yarn run watch

It will update the bouledogue.css file as you work on any .scss file in the scss folder.
# Demo 
Bouledogue is used on [my own portfolio website](https://www.playerfrais.online).

# Why a Bouledogue
My parents owns a French Bouledogue (named Jaya) so i quite like this breed, as simple as that.
