# Bouledogue 🐶

## 🐕CSS framework made in SCSS with SASS Loader🐩
# What is Bouledogue
Bouledogue is a CSS framework made in SCSS on top of [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) and [Systematize](https://github.com/mvasilkov/systematize), the main goal behind it's creation was to learn SCSS and make my own 'personnal' CSS framework. As of today i only learned to use Bootstrap, so Bouledogue will be quite a bit inspired by it. The second objective by making Bouledogue is to get more confortable with front end web developpement, since i'm mostly a back end PHP developper. 🐾
# Installation
## From GitHub
1. Download the last version of bouledogue.css from the release tab or build from source files
2. Include it to your index.html, index.php or whatever
3. Done 🐶
# Developpement
Since it's a learning project i don't plan to merge pull requests or ask for contribution on this project, however feel free to fork it.

Also for developpement purposes, i suggest to use the watch script instead of the build one.
> yarn run watch

It will update the bouledogue.css file as you work on any .scss file in the scss folder.
# Demo 
Bouledogue is used on [my own portfolio website](https://www.playerfrais.online).

# Why a Bouledogue
My parents owns a French Bouledogue (named Jaya) so i quite like this breed, as simple as that.
